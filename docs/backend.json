    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage user data and sessions for the MultaMind application. It prioritizes security and scalability, adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence and Structural Segregation.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The design focuses on path-based ownership for user data, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules.  User documents and session documents are directly owned by the user ID derived from `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **Structural Segregation:** User-specific data (user profiles and sessions) is stored in collections segregated by user ID, ensuring homogeneous security posture within each collection. This simplifies security rules by making them context-specific to individual users.\n*   **QAPs:** The path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`) inherently supports secure list operations (QAPs) as rules can easily filter based on the `userId` derived from authentication.\n\nThis structure facilitates simple and robust security rules, minimizing complexity and ensuring secure access to user data."
